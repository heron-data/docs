Heron Data helps you unlock the full value of financial transaction data with minimal work.

## What we enable you to do

To get started with the tutorial, pick the use case that most applies to you!

**Core use cases**:

- :star: &nbsp [As a developer or PM, I want my transaction feed to look beautiful (sync flow)](use-cases/beautiful-transactions)

- :bank: &nbsp [As a developer, I want to implement Heron Data for SMB underwriting (async flow)](use-cases/smb-underwriting)

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: &nbsp [As a PM, I want to give financial insights to an SMB or Start-up](use-cases/smb-analytics)

- :lock: &nbsp [As a developer or PM, I want to lock cards to merchants](use-cases/merchant-locking)

**Other use cases**:

Please contact us for more information on these:

- :deciduous_tree: &nbsp As a PM, I want to estimate a consumer's carbon footprint from their bank data
- :black_joker: &nbsp As a PM, I want to understand a consumer's gambling behaviours
- :information_desk_person: &nbsp As an underwriter, I want to understand a consumer's risk profile

## Data Flows

To ensure seamless integration with Heron, we offer two different data flows tailored to your specific use case:

### Sync Data Flow

The **sync** data flow provides instantaneous responses, making it the ideal choice for fast merchant enrichment tasks such as retrieving logos and cleaning up names. It also offers categorization functionality, although with slightly lower accuracy compared to the _async_ flow.

### Async Data Flow

The **async** data flow delivers fast responses, with a p95 response time of approximately 3 minutes. This data flow is specifically designed for high-accuracy transaction categorization and comprehensive merchant enrichment.

For a more in-depth understanding of the differences between the sync and async data flows, please refer to our [Sync vs Async FAQ](FAQs/sync-vs-async.md) page.

We strive to make the integration process as user-friendly as possible, and these two data flows cater to various integration requirements, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for our users.
