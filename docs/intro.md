Heron Data allows you to underwrite small business faster and with greater confidence. Bank data is the immutable source of truth for a business. We parse bank transaction data either from PDF bank statements or via aggregators like Plaid. Leveraging our proprietary ML models, we extract key information from the transactions and categorize them into your desired output helping you to underwrite small businesses.

## What we enable you to do

To get started with the tutorial, pick the use case that most applies to you!

**Core use case**:

- :bank: [I want to implement Heron Data for cash flow underwriting](use-cases/smb-underwriting)

**Other use cases**:

- :lock: [I want to lock credit cards to merchants to control spending for certain accounts](use-cases/merchant-locking)

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: [I want to enrich transactions with merchant information to report on customers' spending trends](use-cases/smb-analytics)

## Data Flows

To ensure seamless integration with Heron, we offer two different data flows tailored to your specific use case. We strive to make the integration process as user-friendly as possible, and these two data flows cater to various integration requirements, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for our users.

### Async Data Flow (recommended for cash flow underwriting)

The **async** data flow delivers fast responses, with a p95 response time of approximately 3 minutes. This data flow is specifically designed for high-accuracy transaction categorization and comprehensive merchant enrichment.

### Sync Data Flow

The **sync** data flow provides instantaneous responses, making it the ideal choice for fast merchant enrichment tasks such as retrieving logos and cleaning up names. 

For a more in-depth understanding of the differences between the sync and async data flows, please refer to our [Sync vs Async FAQ](FAQs/sync-vs-async.md) page.
