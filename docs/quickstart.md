# Quickstart

Start enriching bank transaction data in a few simple steps.

## 1. Get access

Please email `hello@herondata.io` to get API credentials and login details to our dashboard.

## 2. Try us out

The easiest way to start sending us bank data is to use our [Postman
Collection](https://postman.herondata.io/) with your API credentials.

open the collection in Postman, click the three ellipses on the right
hand side of the collection in the pane on the left, select "edit", then
"Authorization" and pick "Basic Auth" in the drop-down and enter your
credentials.

Send a `POST /transactions` request with your data and see the results!

:::tip
By clicking the three ellipses in the middle pane and selecting "code", you
can see code snippets for the request you're currently making. You can use
these as an example of how to integrate us into your codebase.

## 3. Integrate us

Once you've tried us out and are ready, you can integrate us into your
workflows in a few ways:

1. **API:** you can call our REST API using any programming language, and we
   also have a [Python library](https://github.com/heron-data/client-python).
   Our detailed technical API docs are [here](/api).

2. **Dashboard**: we offer a [user interface](https://dashboard.herondata.io)
   so you can use oru product without writing a single line of code. You can
   create companies, upload transactions via various file formats and analyze
   and visualize the results of our enrichment in your browser.

Depending on your use case, one might be more appropriate than the other.
Please go through the [Use Cases](/use-cases) documentation for more details.
