# Frequently asked questions

## General

### What do you offer?

**General Features**: *Available out-of-the-box*

* **Merchant** - canonical merchant name, URL, logo, icon and Merchant Category Codes
* **Clean description** - the most relevant part of the description string
* **Recurrency** - whether a transaction is recurring vs. one-off
* **Intra-Account Transfers** - feature indicating transactions with corresponding inflows/outflows

**Custom Features**:

* **Categorization** - our approach combines a variety of heuristics, machine learning, and NLP approaches for labelling
* **Feedback** - continually improve your model by providing feedback

For certain use cases that require very high accuracy and coverage, we offer
asynchronous labelling services that include manual review steps. This is
appropriate for some SME lending settings, or the creation of a ground-truth
data set for ML applications. Contact us for more info!

### How do I interact with the product?

Enrichment is accessed via our [API](/api) or via our
[dashboard](https://dashboard.herondata.io).

Please get in touch to get API and dashboard credentials.

### Where can I get bank data from?
Our customers access bank transaction data either through an third-party
provider (e.g., Plaid, Truelayer) or themselves generate bank transaction data
(e.g. by issuing a card or hosting a checking account). While we do not offer
the direct bank connection, we have deep expertise in this area and can help
you get set up with a provider.
